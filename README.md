# Survey-Evolution-DS
This is the repo which records the evolution of LM-based dialogue system. We list works in each stage, and will constantly update it, welcome to raise a issue to add new works!!

- Task-oriented Dialogue System (TOD)
- Open-domain Dialogue System (ODD)
    - Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
    - Dialogue State Tracking (DST)
    - Dialogue Policy Learning (DST)
    - Natural Language Generation (NLG)
- Unified Dialogue System (UniDS)
